# Logic Gates Python Program

This Python program simulates basic logic gates (AND, OR, and NOT) and displays their results based on user input. It is a simple command-line tool for educational purposes, ideal for understanding how logic gates work.

## Features

- **AND Gate**: Takes two binary inputs (0 or 1) and returns the logical AND result.
- **OR Gate**: Takes two binary inputs (0 or 1) and returns the logical OR result.
- **NOT Gate**: Takes a single binary input (0 or 1) and returns the logical NOT result.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `logic_gates.py`.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python logic_gates.py
