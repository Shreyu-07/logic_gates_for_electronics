# logic_gates_for_electronics
Great! The updated code is correct, and it will produce the truth tables for all four basic logic gates without any errors. When you run the code, it will print the truth tables............

# 1 )Function Definitions:

o logical_and(a, b): This function takes two boolean values, a and b, and returns their logical AND operation.
o logical_or(a, b): This function takes two boolean values, a and b, and returns their logical OR operation.
o logical_not(a): This function takes a single boolean value, a, and returns its logical NOT operation.
o logical_xor(a, b): This function takes two boolean values, a and b, and returns their logical XOR operation.

# 2)print_truth_table(gate_func, gate_name) Function:

o This function is responsible for printing the truth table of a given logic gate.
o It takes two arguments:
o gate_func: The function corresponding to the logic gate (e.g., logical_and, logical_or, etc.).
o gate_name: A string representing the name of the logic gate (e.g., "AND", "OR", etc.).
o Inside the function, it checks if the gate_name is "NOT". If so, it handles the NOT gate separately since it only takes one input.
o For the other gates (AND, OR, and XOR), it iterates through all possible combinations of input values (True/1 and False/0) and prints the corresponding output values

# 30)if __name__ == "__main__":

o This is the entry point of the program. It ensures that the code inside this block only runs when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module.
o It calls the print_truth_table function for each logic gate with the appropriate function and gate name as arguments.

              When you run the code, it will produce the truth tables for the four basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, and XOR), as shown in the previous example.
The output consists of all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output values for each gate. 
The code is well-organized and reusable, allowing you to add more logic gates or customize the output as needed.
